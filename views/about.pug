            | Hello, again &#128075; Thanks for reading till here. The abbreviated tale of my life is this: I was raised to be a tennis player, which had me chasing half-day schools and flexible curriculums so I could spend more time training. By college, I did play on a college team, but at the cost of having little patience for traditional classrooms. So I went to art school: the Savannah College of Art Design (SCAD). And while craft schools like SCAD teach technical skills from day one without bloated lessons, the curriculum ultimately fails to teach application&mdash;stopping once the project looks pretty and well before the idea is engineered into an actual product. <br/><br/> So here I am, four years later, having studied Photography, Graphic Design, Motion Graphics, Art History, Advertising, and Creative Writing. Here I am, alas, where I always wished to be at the engineering level. May my prototypes not die pretty, but may they live without compromise in a breathing body of code.
