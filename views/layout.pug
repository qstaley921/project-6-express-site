              | He was born a philosopher, though he went to school for design. In his freetime he writes poetry, though his best lines are stuck in iMessage threads. <br/><br/>His coding is a means to an end: to create wonderful ideas and applications, and to not let ability inhibit the plan. Of course, even this end is just another means to a different end: to enjoy the passing of time, and to learn life.
