        | My name is Quentin, and this is my Treehouse Portfolio site. You can see my 'real' portfolio at #[a(href="https://qstaley.com" target="blank") Q Staley Dot Com], but that project is slow-roasting on the back-burner while I complete my #[a(href="https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree" target="blank") Team Treehouse JavaScript Techdegree]. The following showcase includes 6 of the 10 techdegree projects (with this website counting as the sixth). The projects were designed by Treehouse, while the JavaScript powering them is all mine&mdash;with the help of my techdegree peers who've reviewed my code. The purpose is to prove, practice, and grow my Web Development skills, and of course, to make a mess of fun along the way. I hope you enjoy, and forever thank you for visiting &#128513;
